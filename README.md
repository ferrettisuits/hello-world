# hello-world
This is my first repository ever, and I am doing the tutorial offered by GitHub. 
it's 3:02 AM EST. Having trouble falling asleep, so I thought I'd pe productive and jump on coursera to learn Ruby on Rails. 
I am excited about this. The thought of building things and applications excites me very much, so I look forward to this chapter of my story.
